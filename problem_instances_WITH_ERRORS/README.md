Github actions are configured to validate that all `problem_instance.*.json` files are compliant with the schema.  If a file ended up in this folder, it's because the script that validates schema compliance found an error in it and moved it here.


See `scripts/problem_instance_json_schema_validation_log.txt` for errors encountered.
